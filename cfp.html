      <h3>Instructions for Authors</h3>
      <p>Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. Submissions are limited to 18 pages in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style, including bibliography and any appendices; each submission must be intelligible and self-contained within this length.</p>
      <p>Authors should consult Springer's authors' guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. Papers should be submitted through the ACNS 2026 submission server (TBA).</p>
      <p>Each submission must be thoroughly anonymized, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions must not duplicate work that was published elsewhere, or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other conference, journal or workshop that has proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.</p>
